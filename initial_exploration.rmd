## Baltimore Crime
### Initial Exploration

Let's begin by loading the three data files in.
We have data on: arrests and victims. Calls is too large of a file so we'll do a separate rmd just of EDA on that one.
```{r importing data}
arrests <- read.csv("Data/BPD_Arrests.csv")
#calls <- read.csv("Data/911_Calls_for_Service.csv")
victims <- read.csv("Data/BPD_Part_1_Victim_Based_Crime_Data.csv")
```

Let's look at the structure of the files.

```{r structure}
str(arrests)
str(victims)
```

Now a summary.

```{r}
summary(arrests)
summary(victims)
```
