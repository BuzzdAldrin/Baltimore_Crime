# Baltimore Crime

Data will not be tracked in Git due to its size.
The data was obtained through the Baltimore Police Department's Website.
https://www.baltimorepolice.org/crime-stats/open-data

To run any of the code I have created to analyze the data, you have to create a Data folder of your git repo. Be sure not to commit that (the gitignore should handle csv files).
Be sure to either name the files the same way that I do or edit the import statements to reflect your new names.
