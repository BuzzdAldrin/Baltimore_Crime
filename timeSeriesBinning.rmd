```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

#Install function courtesy of CSCI 349
my.install <- function(pkg){
  if (!(pkg %in% installed.packages()[,1])){
    install.packages(pkg)
  }
  return (require(pkg, character.only=TRUE))
}

#Load Data
load("cleanedData.RData")
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

####Time Series Binning
These data sets are a time series. Every event is linked to events before and after in strict order. Remove the time and we lose the inherit relationship. I would like to bin data by hour to perform more generic time series analysis.

```{r time series binning}

```
